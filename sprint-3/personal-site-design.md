What is your site's primary purpose?
My site's primary purpose is to inform the user on how to become a Junior Web Developer.

Who is your target audience?
My target audience is adults who are keen to become Junior Web developers.

I'd like site visitors to interact with my site regularly, efficiently and in a positive way. Simple but significant web site to encourage users to follow their dreams in becoming a Web Developers.

I'd like to build my site one step at a time using wireframes, ask for feedback or validate the user experience, then build on that further.
